# The Dart Bag-of-Tricks
## A collection of (mostly) general libraries to make coding [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org/) more fun.

Starting by porting bits of the [PL javascript library](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/pl) and Google's [Closure javascript library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/) to enable some interesting scenarios.

## Highlights

### bot -- default library
 * __collection__
 * __color__
     * `RgbColor`, `HslColor` with associated conversions back and forth
     * `RgbColor` supports to/from hex
 * __events__
 * __exceptions__
 * __graph__
 * __math__
     * `Coordinate`, `Box`, `Size`, `Vector`, `AffineTransfrom`
 * __property__
     * A general model for supporting runtime-defined properties supported objects.
     * This functionality is inspired by the Dependency Property model in WPF/Silverlight.

### async
  * `FutureValue`: an abstract model for async conversions via `Future<T>`
  * `SendPortValue`: an implementation of `FutureValue` using isolates.

## Blocking Bugs
Bugs blocking me from compiling to Javascript.

_None so far._

## Annoying Bugs
Bugs that cause code smells.

### Allow `final static` fields to be non-constants.
  * __Scenario:__ Allowing classes to define a `Property` using `static final Property<bool> isMouseOver = new Property<bool>('isMouseOver');`
  * __Work-around__
      * Remove `GlobalId` from `Property`. Created `NoneHashMap` to store non-hashable `Property` instances and use instance identity to distinguish them.
  * __Issues__
      * I'd love to be able to make `Property` hashable.
  * __Related bugs:__
