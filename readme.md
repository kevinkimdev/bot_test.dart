# dartlib

By [Kevin Moore](https://github.com/kevmoo) ([@kevmoo](http://twitter.com/kevmoo))

Starting by porting bits of the [PL javascript library](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/pl) and Google's [Closure javascript library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/) to enable some interesting scenarios.

### Current Status

 * Core classes from Closure: `Coordinate, Rect, Size, Vec2, AffineTransfrom`
 * From PL: parts of the property model, a lot of the retained library, including panels and hit testing

Building and running on Dart SDK [8022](https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-continuous/8022/)
